# Reusable Subheading Component

The `Subheading` component is a simple yet flexible React component designed to render a paragraph element (`<p>`) with customizable padding and additional styles. This component is ideal for creating subheadings or any text that requires specific padding or styling.

## Component Code

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Subheading = ({ text, className }) => (
    <p className={`xs:px-4 ${className}`}>{text}</p>
);

export default Subheading;
```

## Component Explanation

- **Props**:
  - `text`: The text to be displayed inside the subheading.
  - `className`: Optional additional CSS classes to further style the subheading.

- **Functionality**:
  - The `Subheading` component uses the Tailwind CSS utility class `xs:px-4` to apply padding on the left and right sides of the text on extra-small screens. The `className` prop allows for additional customization if needed.
  - This component is useful for ensuring consistent padding across subheadings while still allowing for additional styling.

## Usage Example

Below is an example of how to use the `Subheading` component in your MDX file:

```mdx
<Subheading text="Section Overview" className="text-gray-500" />
```

## Output

The rendered output of the above example would display a subheading with the text "Section Overview" in gray, with padding applied on extra-small screens.
