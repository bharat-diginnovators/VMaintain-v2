# Installation

This guide will walk you through setting up the ATS project using React and Vite. Vite is a fast and modern build tool that provides a great development experience for React applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** or **Yarn** (npm comes with Node.js; Yarn is an alternative package manager)

You can verify the installation by running the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-ats-project.git
```

- Replace `your-username/your-ats-project` with the actual repository URL.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd your-ats-project
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary packages by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the dependencies required for the project.

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server and see your application in action, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will start a development server and open your project in the default web browser. The server should be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## 4. Open the Project in Your Editor

Open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code):

```bash
code .
```

This command opens the current directory in VS Code.

## Building for Production

When you're ready to build your project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Vite will bundle your application and output the static files in the `dist` directory. These files can be deployed to any static hosting service.
