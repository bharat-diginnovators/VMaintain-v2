# Installation

This guide will walk you through setting up the ATS project using React and Vite. Vite is a fast and modern build tool that provides a great development experience for React applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** or **Yarn** (npm comes with Node.js; Yarn is an alternative package manager)

You can verify the installation by running the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Setting Up the Project
### 1. Create a New Vite Project
To get started, use the following command to create a new React project with Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-ats-project --template react
```

- Replace my-ats-project with your desired project name.
- The --template react flag tells Vite to set up the project using the React template.

 ### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd my-ats-project
```
This command will install all the packages required for the project.

## Running the Development Server
To start the development server and see your application in action, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will start a development server and open your project in the default web browser. The server should be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## 4. Open the Project in Your Editor
Open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code):

```bash
code .
```

This command opens the current directory in VS Code.

## Building for Production
When you're ready to build your project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```
Vite will bundle your application and output the static files in the dist directory. These files can be deployed to any static hosting service.
